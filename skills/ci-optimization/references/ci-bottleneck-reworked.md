# Linear CI case study

Attribution: Mufeez Amjad, Linear. [Read the original article](https://linear.app/now/ci-bottleneck-reworked).
This is a selective paraphrased summary, not an archived copy of the article.

## Findings

Linear measured PR waiting time separately from runner consumption. Despite
substantial test growth, it reduced waiting and approximately halved runner time
per test.

- Improve prerequisite jobs: narrow checkouts, address stalled fetches, and move
  bookkeeping outside the merge gate.
- Reduce repeated setup through prepared images, scoped dependency installs,
  schema snapshots, and consolidation of short checks.
- Measure caches against rebuilding. Linear found one dependency cache slower
  to restore than a scoped installation.
- Balance test files before adding shards. Shared module state required explicit
  eligibility and cleanup; incompatible tests retained isolation.
