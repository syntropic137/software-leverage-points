# Versioning

## Overview

Versioning is the social contract a released artifact carries with its consumers. Done well, the versioning scheme is declared, the changelog names user-visible changes, deprecations precede removals, the public surface is explicitly classified, and version bumps cannot drift across manifest files. Done poorly, breaking changes hide behind patch bumps, the changelog says "various improvements," removals surprise consumers at upgrade time, and version edits drift between `package.json` and `pyproject.toml` because nobody automated the bump.

**Core principle:** Versioning is a stated contract, applied consistently, with deprecation as the bridge between accretion and breakage. The scheme matters less than the discipline of stating it and following it.

## Core Principles

### 1. Declare the versioning scheme; apply it consistently (scope: publicly-versioned APIs)

This principle scopes to artifacts versioned for consumers other than the producing team: published libraries, public APIs, deployable artifacts whose version consumers pin on. When the scope applies: the project declares which versioning scheme it follows, in `README` or release docs, and applies it without exceptions.

**Multiple valid versioning schemes exist:**

- **Semver (semantic versioning):** MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH; MAJOR for incompatible changes, MINOR for additions, PATCH for fixes.
- **Calver (calendar versioning):** YYYY.MM or YY.MM.PATCH; the version encodes when, not what.
- **ZeroVer (0.x.y permanent):** explicitly opting out of stability commitments; legitimate for projects that document the stance.

The principle is: state the scheme, apply it consistently, document the choice. The red flag is "no stated scheme" or "inconsistent application," not "did not pick semver." For semver specifically: a breaking change at minor or patch is a contract violation regardless of the changelog.

### 2. Changelog names user-visible changes per release (scope: any released artifact)

This principle scopes to any artifact with versioned releases (libraries, services with API versions, deployable artifacts with rollback semantics). When the scope applies: a `CHANGELOG.md`, release notes, or equivalent names the user-visible changes per release. Entries describe the user-facing impact, not the implementation detail.

**Multiple valid changelog formats exist:** Keep a Changelog (six categories: Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security), conventional-commits-generated changelog, custom format, or release-notes paragraphs. The principle is: pick one, populate it with user-visible language, keep it current. The red flag is "various improvements" entries or empty release sections, not "did not use Keep a Changelog specifically."

### 3. Deprecate before removing; document the migration path

A function, flag, or config key removed in version N must have been marked deprecated in N-1 (or earlier), with a named removal version and a documented migration path. An undocumented removal forces every consumer to discover the change at upgrade time, often in production.

Deprecation is the bridge between accretion (safe to add) and breakage (not safe to remove). The deprecation discipline is one minor cycle of warnings before removal at the next major; that is the cheapest possible migration aid.

### 4. Public surface is explicitly classified

A library or API that exports every internal helper alongside its public types makes every export a de facto stability commitment. Naming the surface (whether by `@public`/`@internal` annotation, underscore prefix, an `__all__`/index file, or a documented stability list) is the prerequisite for honest semver: the maintainer can refactor internals safely only when "internal" is stated.

### 5. Version bumps are automated or scripted across all manifest files

A single source of truth (a `bump-version` script, a release-please bot, a workspace tool) keeps every manifest in lockstep with one command. Manual edits drift; drifted versions confuse consumers, package managers, and observability.

**Multiple valid bump mechanisms exist:** commit-driven automation (release-please, semantic-release based on conventional commits), tag-driven (`git tag` triggers a release pipeline), manual bump via a single script that updates every manifest. The principle is: one command updates every manifest. The red flag is "version field edited by hand in some manifests but not others," not "did not adopt release-please."

### 6. Commit-message convention supports release tooling (scope: projects with automated release tooling)

This principle scopes to projects using automated changelog or version-bump tooling that derives intent from commit messages. When the scope applies: a stated convention governs commit messages so the tool can categorize changes correctly.

**Multiple valid commit conventions exist:** Conventional Commits (`feat:`/`fix:`/`feat!:`), gitmoji, project-defined prefixes, or PR-label-driven categorization. The principle is: state the convention, enforce it (commit hook or PR check), let the release tool consume it. The red flag is "automation expects a convention but commits ignore it," not "did not use Conventional Commits."

### 7. Half-automation is worse than none

A `release-please` or `semantic-release` setup that bumps the version cleanly but produces a generic or empty changelog produces the appearance of release discipline without the content. If automation produces opaque entries, fix the commit messages, the config, or the categorization rule, do not ship the empty changelog.

## Red Flags - STOP

- No stated versioning scheme; consumers cannot tell whether MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH means semver, calver, or something else
- Breaking change shipped at minor or patch under semver; signature changed, export removed, or config schema incompatibly altered without a major bump
- Changelog entries that say "various improvements," "internal cleanup," or "bug fixes" with no specific user-visible items, or release sections empty
- Deprecation removed without a prior warning release, or removed without a documented migration path
- Library or API exports every internal helper alongside its public types with no `@public`/`@internal` distinction or stability classification
- Version edited by hand in some manifest files but not others (`package.json` and `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py` drifted)
- Project adopts conventional-commits or release-please but commit messages routinely ignore the convention; the changelog is a lie
- Project past its first production users still on `0.x.y` permanently with no documented stance on why and no plan to ship 1.0 (or to declare ZeroVer explicitly)

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|---|---|
| "It's a small change, minor is fine" | Consumers pin on the contract; "small" at minor still breaks pinned builds |
| "Nobody reads the changelog" | The next person debugging a regression reads it; populate it for them |
| "We deprecated it in chat" | Chat is not a release artifact; the deprecation is in the warning released to consumers |
| "The version is in `package.json`, that's enough" | Until `pyproject.toml` and the docs site config drift; the public version is whichever consumer hits which manifest first |
| "0.x means we can change anything" | Real users are pinned anyway; the version is an honesty marker, not a license |
| "Conventional commits are too rigid" | Half-following them produces wrong changelogs; commit fully or pick a different convention |
| "Internal/public is obvious from context" | Until a refactor of "obvious internals" breaks a consumer that imported them; classify the surface |

## Key Patterns

```
✅ README: "This project follows Semantic Versioning 2.0.0."
❌ No stated scheme; version 1.4.0 → 1.5.0 contains a breaking signature change
```

```
✅ ## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-28
   ### Added
   - `parseStrict` option on `validate()` rejects unknown keys
   ### Deprecated
   - `legacyParse()`; will be removed in 3.0.0; use `parse({ strict: true })`
❌ ## 2.3.0
   - Various improvements and bug fixes
```

```
✅ Version 1.x emits DeprecationWarning on `oldFn()`; 2.0 removes it; migration named in CHANGELOG
❌ Version 2.0 removes `oldFn()` with no prior warning; consumers discover at upgrade
```

```
✅ Public exports listed in index; internal modules underscore-prefixed; stability documented
❌ Every internal helper exported; refactoring internals breaks consumers
```

```
✅ One command bumps version in package.json, pyproject.toml, __init__.py, and docs config
❌ Version edited by hand in three manifests; one is forgotten; published version drifts
```

## Why This Matters

Versioning is the contract every consumer reads when deciding whether to upgrade. The cost of getting it wrong is paid in broken downstream builds, surprise outages at upgrade time, and the slow erosion of trust that the version number means anything.

Without disciplined versioning:

- Consumers cannot pin safely; every upgrade is a roulette wheel.
- Breaking changes hide in patch releases and detonate at the worst times.
- Deprecations surprise consumers in production because nothing was announced.
- Internal refactors break consumers who imported "obvious internals."
- Manifest drift means the published version disagrees with itself.
- Half-automated release tooling produces opaque changelogs that consumers learn to ignore.

With disciplined versioning:

- Consumers know what a version bump means and can plan accordingly.
- Breaking changes carry a major bump and a documented migration path.
- Deprecations precede removals by at least one cycle, with named alternatives.
- Public surface is classified; internal refactors are safe by construction.
- Every manifest stays in lockstep with one command.
- The changelog is a release artifact consumers actually read.

## Growth examples

Soft sketch; not a checklist. Where appropriate is shaped by the target's maturity.

- **POC / prototype:** version field exists; the README states the project's stance (pre-release, no stability promised, or stated scheme). Awareness that consumers will need a changelog before the first external user.
- **Growing internal tool:** versioning scheme declared; changelog populated per release with user-visible entries; first deprecation discipline (warning before removal) established; version-bump script keeps manifests in lockstep.
- **Shared library:** public surface classified; deprecation policy documented in CONTRIBUTING; changelog follows a stated format; commit-message convention enforced; release tooling produces meaningful entries from commit messages.
- **Production service:** versioned API contract (URL prefix or header); breaking changes go through deprecation cycle; changelog reviewed before release; release tooling is automated; manifest drift is impossible by construction.
- **Safety-critical:** version is part of the release artifact's signed manifest; deprecation cycles are formally tracked; migration paths are tested as part of CI; changelog is reviewed and approved as a release artifact, not generated and forgotten.

- **David Heinemeier Hansson, on the cost of premature 1.0; the inverse argument on permanent 0.x.** Backs principle 1 from both sides. Both premature 1.0 and permanent 0.x are failure modes of the same axis: state the stance and apply it.

## Suggested technologies (as of 2026-04-28)

These go stale fast; the date is the "as-of." Verify currency before adopting. The principles above outlast specific tools; if a tool here is no longer maintained, the patterns transfer to its replacement.

- **Versioning schemes:** Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (semver.org), Calendar Versioning (calver.org), ZeroVer (0ver.org for the explicitly-permanent-0.x stance).
- **Changelog formats:** Keep a Changelog (manually maintained with six categories), conventional-changelog generators (auto-derived from commit messages), towncrier (Python; per-PR snippets merged at release), changesets (JS/TS monorepos).
- **Release automation (commit-driven):** release-please (Google), semantic-release (commitlint + plugin ecosystem), changesets (per-package versioning in monorepos).
- **Release automation (tag-driven):** GoReleaser (Go), cargo-release (Rust), `npm version` plus a CI tag-trigger workflow.
- **Commit-message conventions:** Conventional Commits, gitmoji, project-defined prefix conventions enforced via commitlint or a pre-commit hook.
- **Public-surface classification:** TypeScript `@public`/`@internal` JSDoc tags via API Extractor; Python `__all__` plus underscore-prefix convention; Rust `pub(crate)` vs `pub`; Go's capitalization-as-visibility rule plus `internal/` directories.
- **Deprecation tooling:** language-native deprecation warnings (`@deprecated` JSDoc, Python `DeprecationWarning`, Rust `#[deprecated]`); migration-tool generators where the change is mechanical (codemods, `jscodeshift`, Rust's `cargo fix --edition`).
